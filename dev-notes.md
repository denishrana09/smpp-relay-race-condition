we can modify the code to use Redis Pub/Sub instead of EventEmitter. This would make the system more scalable and allow for multiple instances of the application to work together. 

The main changes are:

1. Removed EventEmitter and replaced it with Redis Pub/Sub
2. Added a separate Redis client for subscriptions (best practice to avoid blocking)
3. Modified `waitForCompletion` to use Redis subscribe instead of EventEmitter
4. Modified `createOrUpdateEntry` to publish to Redis channel instead of emitting events

This change brings several benefits:

1. **Scalability**: Multiple instances of the application can now work together since Redis Pub/Sub works across all connected clients
2. **Reliability**: Redis is more reliable for message delivery than in-memory EventEmitter
3. **Persistence**: If the application crashes, Redis Pub/Sub can handle reconnection gracefully
4. **Monitoring**: Redis Pub/Sub activities can be monitored using Redis CLI tools

Note that we're creating two Redis clients because it's recommended to use separate connections for Pub/Sub operations. When a Redis client is in subscriber mode, it cannot issue other commands, so we need a separate client for regular operations.

Remember to properly clean up the Redis connections when shutting down the server. You might want to update the shutdown handler in server.js:

```javascript:server.js
process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
  await messageQueue.redis.quit();
  await messageQueue.subscriber.quit();
  process.exit(0);
});
```

This implementation will be more robust and scalable than the EventEmitter version, especially if you need to run multiple instances of your application.
